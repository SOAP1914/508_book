# Color Contrast

Ensure that foreground and background color combinations provide sufficient contrast when viewed by someone having color deficits or when viewed on a black and white screen.

Two colors provide good color visibility if the brightness difference and the color difference between the two colors are greater than a set range.

The range for color brightness difference is 125. The range for color difference is 500.

####Types of Color Blindness

Examples:

```Deuteranope``` (a form of red/green color deficit)<br>

```Protanope``` (another form of red/green color deficit)<br>

```Tritanope``` (a blue/yellow deficit- very rare)
