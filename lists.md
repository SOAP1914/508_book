# Lists

Lists help screen readers understand the type of the element and the number of items in the element, and provide easier navigation via list commands specific to screen readers.

HTML provides tags that express lists. Most likely you are already familiar with the `ul` (<strong>unordered list</strong>) and `ol` (<strong>ordered list</strong>) tags.

The Screen Reader will announce `'List 3 items'`.

```HTML
<ul>
  <li>Eggs</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
  <li>Bread</li>
</ul>
```
