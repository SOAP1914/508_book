508 Best Practices
=======

OZONE Platform, developed as a government project, must accommodate all 508 disability requirements as required by federal law. In order to accommodate, some general purpose guidelines will be defined, and must be tested for release as part of the program lifecycle.


###Section 508 Refresh

The US Access Board is in the process of updating the Section 508 requirements and, according to estimates, should be finalizing the new requirements at the end of 2015. Once the changes come into effect, the US Access Board will require compliance with the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 rather than trying to maintain their own unique set of standards. WCAG 2.0 Level AA will be the minimum to comply with Section 508 once the new standards come into effect.
