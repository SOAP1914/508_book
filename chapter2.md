###Labeling Form Controls and Interactive Elements
Accessible labels are necessary to make several other types of elements understandable, such as inputs, widgets, and ARIA landmark regions. Accessible labels that create a delightful experience are:

1. Concise -- 1 to 3 simple words. Only occasionally as many as 5 words.
2. Meaningful -- accurately convey the purpose of the element.

There are many ways to label an interactive element such as a button or an input field.
